# Brain Tumor Detection from MRI images using ML techniques
The project contains various classification models like: </br> 
* CNN </br> 
* Random Forest </br> 
* SVM </br> 
* KNN </br> 

We have used many machine learning techniques including: </br> 
* Hyperparameter tuning </br> 
* Data augmentation </br> 
* Hierarchical Classification </br> 

This project was built with Jupyter Notebook and various python packages like Keras and Scikit-Learn.
