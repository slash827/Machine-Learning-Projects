# Hello-World
This is my first project in GitHub.
I'm a M.Sc student in Computer Science from Israel.

In my first project I implemented a ML model using logistic regression in python.
I created two models one to classify iris species and another to classify wine types.

I also created models that deal with Malware Detection using data extracted from PE Headers of suspicious files.
